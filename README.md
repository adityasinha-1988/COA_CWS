COA Assignment Portal - Student Guide
Welcome, Students!
Website: https://adityasinha-1988.github.io/COA_CWS/
Welcome to the official portal for your Computer Organization and Architecture (CSE2103) assignment. This page has all the information you need to complete your case study and simulation project. Please read all instructions carefully.

Assignment Overview
This project is worth a total of 10 marks and is divided into two main parts. The goal is to give you a deep, practical understanding of a real-world processor architecture.

Part 1: Architecture Simulation (5 Marks)
You will be required to write a simple assembly language program for your assigned processor. The program should perform a basic task like calculating a factorial or generating a Fibonacci sequence. The goal is to get hands-on experience with the instruction set of your architecture.

Part 2: Video Presentation (5 Marks)
You will create a 7-10 minute video that has two sections:

Case Study Presentation: A presentation explaining the key features, design, and history of your assigned processor.

Code Demonstration: A live screen recording where you explain your assembly code and run it in a simulator to show the final output.

How to Use This Portal
Follow these simple steps to get started:

Find Your Topic: Use the search bar at the top of the page. Enter your registration number to find your group members and your assigned processor.

Read the Instructions: Click on the "Part 1" and "Part 2" tabs to see the detailed instructions, guiding questions for the presentation, and a list of recommended simulators.

Check Submission Rules: Pay close attention to the submission rules, especially for the video. Make sure your video link works and has the correct access permissions.

Submit Your Work: Near the deadline, a link to a Microsoft Form will be activated in the "Submission Portal" section. You will use this form to upload your code and video link.
